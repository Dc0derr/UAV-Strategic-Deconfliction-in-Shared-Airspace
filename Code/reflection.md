# Reflection & Justification Document

## Design Decisions & Architecture
- The system is modular: data models, ingestion, deconfliction logic, visualization, and interface are separated for clarity and extensibility.
- Data classes (`Waypoint`, `FlightPath`, `Mission`) support both 2D and 3D (altitude) for extra credit.
- The deconfliction logic uses linear interpolation and time-stepped checks for precise spatio-temporal conflict detection.

## Spatial and Temporal Checks
- Spatial checks use a configurable safety buffer (default 5 meters) and Euclidean distance in 3D.
- Temporal checks are performed at 1-second intervals, aligning all drones' positions in time for accurate conflict detection.
- Conflict explanations include time, location, other drone, and distance.

## AI Integration
- AI (Cursor AI) was used to:
  - Plan the architecture and file structure
  - Generate boilerplate and core logic
  - Draft visualization and documentation
  - Suggest edge cases and testing strategies
- All AI-generated code was reviewed and refined for correctness and clarity.

## Testing Strategy & Edge Cases
- (To be added) Automated tests will cover:
  - Conflict-free and conflict-present scenarios
  - Edge cases: overlapping start/end times, near-miss distances, 2D/3D missions
- Manual testing via the main script and visualizations

## Scalability Discussion
To handle real-world data from tens of thousands of drones:
- **Distributed Computing**: Partition airspace and time, use distributed servers for parallel conflict checks.
- **Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Stream flight plans and telemetry, use message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ).
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Use spatial indexing (R-trees, KD-trees) and time-binning to reduce pairwise checks.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Redundant servers, failover mechanisms, and robust error handling.
- **API & UI**: Expose REST/gRPC APIs for real-time queries, dashboards for operators.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a scalable, modular approach to UAV deconfliction, leveraging AI tools for rapid development and clear documentation.
